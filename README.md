Gleam bindings for ðŸš€ https://data-star.dev/

Datastar helps build reactive web applications with the simplicity of server-side rendering.

This repository contains two packages for now:

- <https://hexdocs.pm/datastar> - To generate Datastar **server sent events** from the backend.
- <https://hexdocs.pm/datastar_wisp> - To use the above package with Wisp.

A lustre package is coming in the future.
